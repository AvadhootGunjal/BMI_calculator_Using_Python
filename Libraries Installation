#Installation of Libraries


Step 1: Install the required libraries

Before you can import these libraries, you need to make sure they are installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip, the Python package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following commands:

pip install tkinter (this is usually included with Python, so you might not need to install it)
pip install pillow (this is the friendly PIL fork, which is more actively maintained)


Step 2: Verify the installations

After installing the libraries, you can verify that they are installed correctly by opening a new terminal or command prompt and typing:

python -c "import tkinter; print(tkinter.__version__)" (this should print the version of tkinter)
python -c "from PIL import Image; print(Image.__version__)" (this should print the version of PIL)
